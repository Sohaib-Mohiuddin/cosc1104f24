In this exercise, you will build a student performance dashboard that does the following tasks:

Data Collection: Collect student data using variables, loops, and conditions.

Each student has a name, age, and a list of grades (at least 3 subjects).
The user should input multiple students (use loops to allow input for at least 5 students).
Use conditions to validate the input data (e.g., age must be a positive number, grades between 0 and 100).
Data Processing: Use functions and libraries to process and analyze the data.

Create a function to calculate the average grade for each student.
Store student information in a MongoDB collection and perform CRUD operations (e.g., Insert students, Retrieve students, Update a student's grade, and Delete a student).
Use NumPy to calculate the overall class average across all students.
Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib to visualize the grades.

Plot the average grade of each student on a bar graph.
Plot a horizontal line for the class average.

Web Scraping (Optional): Use BeautifulSoup to scrape a website and display a motivational quote for students. (You can choose a simple website with quotes or use a static file.)

Image Processing (Optional): Use an image processing library (like Pillow) to create a certificate for the top-performing student by converting an image to grayscale and overlaying the student's name.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Define a class Student with properties name, age, and grades.
Implement methods inside the Student class to calculate the average grade and display the student's information.
Create a class Classroom to handle multiple students, store them in a list, and calculate the class average.
Expected Output:
A printed list of students with their average grades.
A MongoDB collection with all student data.
A bar graph showing each student's average grade.
(Optional) A motivational quote for students.
(Optional) A grayscale certificate for the top student.
